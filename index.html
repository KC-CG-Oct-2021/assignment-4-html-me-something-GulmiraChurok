      <p>1. Rome (Italy. Rome changed my time perception with its B.C. artifacts. I will always want to go back to Rome!</p>

      <p>2. Paris (France). Somehow I didn't find the city very romantic. But Versailles is the most beautiful place I've ever visited.</p>

      <p>3. Mainz (Germany). I lived in Mainz for three years. It stays in my memory as a warm, beautiful and calm city.</p>
      <img src = "images/Mainz.jpg" height = "auto" width = 700px >
      <P>4. Dushanbe (Tadjikistan). Sunny city which has the second biggest Buddha statue in the world!</P>
      <img src = "images/Dushanbe.jpg" height = "auto" width = 700px >
      <p>5. Boston (USA). Boston is a place where I for the first time saw the ocean, watched whales, and tried lobster.</p>
